# RGB-Timer-Coolest-Projects-

Hey there, I am Parth Singh- creator of this device. I am this for Coolest Projects Competition by Raspberry Pi Foundation.
This device do not have any major usecase. However this could encourage some young creator by giving them access to all the parts of the device, for eg. Fan, RGB LED, Timer.
