# RGB-Timer-Coolest-Projects-

Hey there, I am Parth Singh- creator of this device. I am this for Coolest Projects Competition by Raspberry Pi Foundation.
This device do not have any major usecase. However this could encourage some young creator by giving them access to all the parts of the device, for eg. Fan, RGB LED, Timer.

## Setting Up the Hardware

Here is the circuit diagram for the device. Make sure to put them right.

**NOTE : I had put a diffuser between the RGB LED and the fan to make it more softer. Also you need to plug the arduino in COM8 of your computer**
